                <h3>AM Radio Reciever</h3>
                <p>This project involved assembling a circuit which could demodulate a carrier 
                    signal at a given frequency and recover its message signal, similar to how an AM radio reciever works. In this case,
                    the message signal was a song. This project was done indivudually and involved constructing amplifiers, bandpass filers,
                    and envelope detectors.<br><br>
                    Aside from the components, the usage of oscilloscopes, signal generators, spectrum analysers, network analysers, and
                    sweep generators were also used to help with debugging and visuallizing the circuit. In the end, the audio it was able
                    to produce was slightly distorted due to the limitations of an analog filter, but you could still clearly make out the sound it
                    produced.

                <h3>Vending Machine Coin Sensor</h3>
                <p>This project utilized a lot of concepts from VLSI circuit design. Designed first by figuring out desired outputs with certain inputs
                    and then constructed a finite state-diagram to match said conditions. With Karnaugh Maps and binary logic, the diagram was 
                    converted to a series of NAND gates. Using Altera Quartus, I designed the circuit and verified that everything was working properly.
                    Afterwards, the circuit was constructed with a coin detectior. I hooked up an LED block that light up patterns to verify 
                    that all the inputs and outputs were working as intended. Some components used included D-flip flops and adders.

                <h3>LED Cube</h3>
                <p>After my first year, my interest in hardware projects skyrocketed and I wanted to 
                    build more circuits. I found the hardware labs I took my first year extremely fun and interesting and I wanted to
                    physically make more hardware projects. After further research, I found out that a 4x4 LED cube project was relativley easy
                    and inexpensive. This project involved making a 4x4 cube with LEDs and connecting it to an Arduino
                    to have it produce patterns. It involved soldering LEDs onto copper wire to make a frame and then connecting
                    all those frames to make a cube.<br><br>
                    However, this project was without its difficulties. I was able to code the Arduino and solder the wire onto the LEDs, but the
                    LEDs always broke off whenever I tried to set it up. This is probably due to my inexperience in soldering as this was my first
                    time doing it as well as the quality of the equipment I was using. Although I wasn't able to make a cube, I was able to construct a
                    4x4 LED plate that worked with the Arduino.

                <h3>Coffee Heat Sensor</h3>
                <p>This project involved designing a circuit which would detect if a mug of coffee was warm or not through contact with
                    a thermistor. If it was warm, a red LED would light up, informing the user. The task was accomplished by three
                    other students and I. We were given resistors, capcitors, thermistors, LEDs, comparators, and potentiometers to fullfil
                     the task. Using the datasheets for the components and manipulating equations, we were able to find the right values 
                     for each component and successfully construct a working circuit.

                <h3>Light-Seeking Car</h3>
                <p>The end goal of this project was to create model car that could navigate away from dark areas and migrate towards areas
                    of light. This project involved the use of transistors, potentiometers, resistors, photodiodes, and capacitors. The frame of the
                    car was built with plastic and a motor was connected to each of the wheels. Potentiometers were used so that I could easily
                    adjust the resistance tthat determined what level of light that was considered "too dark". Photodiodes were used as light 
                    detectors and one was connected to each of the wheels to determine if that wheel should stop moving or not.</p>

                <h3>Others</h3>
                <p>Personal Computer - Researched parts and built a personal computer. This was my first introduction to anything
                    hardware related and was the reason I became interested in electrical engineering.

                <p>This is the website your looking at right now! Everything you see on this website was coded all by me (no templates)
                    through HTML, CSS, and JavsScript that I learned myself. (The moving particle effect on the home page was borrowed
                    , source can be found in the source code)

                <h3>Bluetooth Speaker</h3>
                <p>After watching DD Electroctech's video in which he built an Alexa and Google speaker for under $30, I got inspired
                    and wanted to build one myself. I am currently designing a circuit that will be incorporated with a Raspberry Pi and
                    a Bluetooth sensor.

                <h3>L502 Processor Emulator</h3>
                <p>Over winter break, I started to gain an interest in computer architecture and wanted to try coding the famous
                    8-bit L502 Processor that was used in the original Apple computers and NES. I am currently emulating the processor
                    in C++ using many resources as references throughout the process.
